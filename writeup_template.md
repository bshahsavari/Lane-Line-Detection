##Road Lane Lines Detection
###A software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car.

---

**The pipeline includes the following features:**

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

###Camera Calibration
The camera is calibrated using a set of "object points" and "image points" that are extracted from calibration images in "./camera_cal/" directory. The image points are extracted from the calibration images by an OpenCV function called `findChessboardCorners()' and visualized with `drawChessboardCorners()` again available in OpenCV. The object points are basically set to be a uniform grid of 9x6 based on the fact that the chessboard had the same number of grid points.

Once the image points and corresponding object points are found, the  camera calibration parameters and distortion matrix are determined by `ret, mtx, dist, rvecs, tvecs = cv2.calibrateCamera(objpoints, imgpoints, gray.shape[::-1],None,None)` where `objpoints` and `imgpoints` are the arrays containing the object points and image points respectively.

The images can then be *undistorted*  by using the distortion matrix and OpenCV function `dst = cv2.undistort(img, mtx, dist, None, mtx)`. Examples of calibration and undistorted images are shown below.

 ###Pipeline (single images)
 
 ####1. Distortion correction on video frames
 The same transformation is applied on the video to undistot the frames. The following figures show two examples of original and undistorted images. Note that most of the objects are farther than the chessboard the undistortion effect is less apparent in this images compared to the calibration ones.

####2. Feature extraction by  color transformation and gradient thresholding
Four methods are implemented for finding the edges from different gradients and color space transformation.

* `s_threshold(img,thresh)`: convets the `img` to HSL colorspace and thresholds the *Saturation (s)* channel
* `abs_sobel_thresh(img, orient, sobel_kernel, thresh)`: cnverts the image to grayscale, calculates the gradient along the `orient` direction using a Sobel kernel with size `sobel_kernel` and binarizes the result based on the given threshold `thres`.
* `mag_thresh(img, sobel_kernel, mag_thresh)`: Similar to `abs_sobel_thresh()` except that it applies the thresholding on the magnitude of gradient instead of a particular direction.
* `dir_threshold(img, sobel_kernel, thresh)`: Similar to `abs_sobel_thresh()` except that it applies the thresholding on the gradient angle instead of the gradient intesity along a particular direction.

After some manual iterations the binarized images are generated by combining the images from gradients along the x-direction and *Saturation* channel thresholding. This is implemented in `combine_thresholds(img)` function. 
The final tuned parameters are given below:

1. sxbinary = abs_sobel_thresh(img, orient='x', sobel_kernel=ksize, thresh=(50, 100))
2. s_binary = s_threshold(img,(170,255))

####3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warper()`, which appears in lines 1 through 8 in the file `example.py` (output_images/examples/example.py) (or, for example, in the 3rd code cell of the IPython notebook).  The `warper()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:

```
src = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 2) - 55, img_size[1] / 2 + 100],
    [((img_size[0] / 6) - 10), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 5 / 6) + 60, img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] / 2 + 55), img_size[1] / 2 + 100]])
dst = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 4), 0],
    [(img_size[0] / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), 0]])

```
This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 585, 460      | 320, 0        | 
| 203, 720      | 320, 720      |
| 1127, 720     | 960, 720      |
| 695, 460      | 960, 0        |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

####4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

Then I did some other stuff and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:

####5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I did this in lines # through # in my code in `my_other_file.py`

####6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in lines # through # in my code in `yet_another_file.py` in the function `map_lane()`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

###Pipeline (video)

####1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)

###Discussion

####1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
